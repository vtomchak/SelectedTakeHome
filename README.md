## Summary
* I built a bit of a backend server from scratch, and put in blank architecture for a MongoDB database, and for future cabability for authorizing users who sign up.
* I combined that backend with a gutted Create React App boiler plate on the front end, and have both servers able to run simulateously.
* The project is deployed to Heroku, and Heroku rebuilds the client server with each deploy.
* The front end uses React for the form logic, with simulated button navigation.
* I used Materializecss as a base for my styling, but altered the ready made styling on every component to get close to the selected website form examples look. The "chips" component is an npm plug in for the courses input.
